The aim of the project is to create a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game using client-server architecture. The game should allow users to play together, where each player can act as a client connected to the server. This project aims to understand concepts related to network programming and interprocess communication. Additionally, it allows for the development of skills in creating graphical user interfaces.
